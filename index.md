## Welcome to CodeBeats 

Code Beats started as a senior project in VCU's College of Engineering. This project asked the question: can realistic-sounding hip hop beats be generated via code? In the fall of 2019, four students explored this question by re-creating popular beats, such as Still Dre and Russian Cream. They quickly discovered that code could generate high-quality, realistic-sounding beats!
